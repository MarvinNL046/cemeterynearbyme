    "review_text": "The Begraafplaats in Woudrichem is a quietly dignified cemetery, impeccably maintained and thoughtfully laid out. Pathways are clean and easy to navigate, and the overall atmosphere strikes a respectful, serene tone that suits the setting perfectly. Gravestones and monuments are well cared for, reflecting a community that honours its past with subtlety and reverence.\nIt’s a place that invites reflection and pays homage to local history with understated elegance—a serene spot for remembrance and contemplation.",
