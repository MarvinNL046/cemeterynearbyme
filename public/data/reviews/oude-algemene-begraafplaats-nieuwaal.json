    "review_text": "Algemene Begraafplaats Nieuwaal, at Kerkstraat 24, is a peaceful and dignified cemetery. The grounds are well looked after — grass neatly trimmed, pathways clear, and gravestones respectfully maintained. There’s a calm in the air; even walking through quietly feels like honoring those who came before.\nWhile amenities are minimal, that simplicity contributes to its serenity. There are no loud distractions, just nature, careful care, and space to reflect. It feels like a place where the community has invested in preserving dignity.\nFive stars for upkeep, respect, and the quiet beauty it offers to residents and visitors alike.",
