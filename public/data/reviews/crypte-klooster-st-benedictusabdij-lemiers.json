    "review_text": "Have stayed here as guest before and became a part of the community for a fewdays.\nIm not a catholic but fitted in with the few days of reflection towards God. The monks have very little distractions due to the minimalist architecture but this enhances their  worship .\nWhat was nice to see was a younger generation of monks having joined since i was last here 10 or so years ago\nIf you want to find peace of mind and are curious about monastic life this is for u!",
