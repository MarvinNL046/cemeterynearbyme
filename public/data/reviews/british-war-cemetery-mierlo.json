I was very moved after reading the comments of local people and local school children in the visitor's book. Dutch people living near the cemetery have taken care and respected the graves and sacrifices of these foreign soldiers for the last 75 years. Thank you.",

    "review_text": "Beautifully kept war cemetery and a credit to the local community. I would drop in here on my rides between Eindhoven and Helmond, read the family stories of desperately young soldiers lost too soon, when the tears welled I'd be on my way. A random reminder of how fortunate the following generations have been and a warning for generations to come. 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these.",
