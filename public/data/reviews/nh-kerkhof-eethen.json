    "review_text": "Cemetery – De Hoek, Eethen — a neat and tranquil little burial ground, maintained with care and modest taste. The setting is quiet and respectful, surrounded by open fields that give it a sense of peace and space. Nothing extravagant here — just calm dignity and proper upkeep.\nFour stars for serenity, simplicity, and that understated rural charm that fits Eethen perfectly.",
