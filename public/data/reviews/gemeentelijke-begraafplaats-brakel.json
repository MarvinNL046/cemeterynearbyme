    "review_text": "The Algemene Begraafplaats Brakel (Dwarssteeg 7c) is a deeply respectful and well-maintained cemetery. Spanning nearly 10,000 m², it has parts of older sections, a newer section, and most recently (since 2013) an expanded area with fresh plantings and paved paths. The entrance is dignified, and you feel immediately that this place is cared for.\nOne of the strengths here is the balance: older graves with history and the newer plots with good layout. Trees and young plantings in the newer part provide a gentler aesthetic flow, benches there invite quiet reflection, and everything appears tidy. While it doesn’t have grand monuments or showy features, its simplicity is part of its grace.\nI give it five stars because it scores highly on dignity, upkeep, respectful environment, and sense of community care. It feels like a place where remembrance is honored — not perfect in grandeur but perfect in heart.",
