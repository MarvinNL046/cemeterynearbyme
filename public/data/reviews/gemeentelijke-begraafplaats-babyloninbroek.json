    "review_text": "Gemeentelijke Begraafplaats Genderen — a peaceful and well-kept resting place, tucked away in a quiet corner of the village. The layout is simple and dignified, with tidy paths and mature trees giving it a calm, reflective atmosphere. It’s the kind of place that shows quiet respect rather than grandeur — understated, but proper.\nFour stars for serenity, order, and that subtle touch of timeless Dutch restraint.",
