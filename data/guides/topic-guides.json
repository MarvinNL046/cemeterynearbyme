          "answer": "Burial vaults range from $1,000 to $10,000+ depending on materials and features. While many cemeteries require vaults to prevent ground settling, you can often use a simple grave liner ($500-$1,000) instead of a full vault."

          "question": "Is cremation better for the environment than burial?",
          "answer": "It depends on the options chosen. Traditional cremation uses significant energy and releases emissions. Traditional burial involves embalming chemicals and non-biodegradable materials. Green burial and alkaline hydrolysis (water cremation) are the most eco-friendly options."
        },
        {
          "question": "What religions prohibit cremation?",
          "answer": "Orthodox Judaism and Islam traditionally prohibit cremation. The Catholic Church now permits it but prefers burial. Eastern Orthodox Christianity generally prohibits it. Most Protestant denominations, Hinduism, and Buddhism allow or encourage cremation."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I have a funeral service with cremation?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. You can have a full traditional funeral service before cremation, a memorial service after cremation, or both. Many families hold viewings with the body present before cremation, just as with burial."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are hybrid options between cremation and burial?",
          "answer": "Options include: cremation with burial of ashes in a cemetery plot, partial cremation with some ashes scattered and some buried, green burial followed by natural decomposition, and aquamation (water cremation) which is gentler on the environment."
