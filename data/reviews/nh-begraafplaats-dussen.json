    "review_text": "Hervormde Begraafplaats Dussen at Binnen 19 is a quietly dignified small cemetery that honors local history. It sits on the site of the old Hervormde Church that was destroyed during WWII, lending the place a weight of memory that resonates. The grounds are well maintained — neat paths, modest gravestones, and a calm atmosphere that encourages reflection rather than haste. It’s not grandiose or tourism-centred, but for what it is, it performs its role with respect and understatement. There are signs that space is tight, and some neighbouring residents have raised concerns about expansion and water drainage with regard to new plots. These seem to be addressed, but it does highlight that even in quiet places like this, practical matters matter. All told, it’s a cemetery that feels rooted in local identity — well cared for, respectful, and suitably serene.",
