    "review_text": "The cemetery in Poederoijen (postal code area 5307 HK) is a quiet and respectfully maintained resting place that carries a strong sense of local history. The grounds are clean and orderly, with well-kept paths and trimmed grass. Trees and plantings around the grave markers contribute to a calm, peaceful atmosphere.\nAlthough there isn’t much in the way of visitor amenities like shelters or large monuments, the simplicity adds to its dignity. Gravestones of different ages show generations of the community, and the feeling is one of careful preservation rather than abandonment.\nI give it five stars because it meets everything that matters in a cemetery: serenity, respect, a maintained environment, and a sense of continuity between past and present.",
