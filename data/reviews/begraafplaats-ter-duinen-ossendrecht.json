    "review_text": "Behind is the woods,a densely water reserve area plenty of trees, heide and wildlife accessible in all directions. You can park in the village street, like poort volksabdij parking, terduinen, wassevendreef, along schapendreef, tennisvereniging \"de meet\" , trambaan and dennenlaan in hoogerheide. Well for sure ter duinen is a little cementery , a funeral care place. A visit is intended for those who had someone buried in the area.",
