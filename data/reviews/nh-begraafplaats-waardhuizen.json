    "review_text": "The Protestantse Begraafplaats in Waardhuizen is a quiet and beautifully kept cemetery that reflects the deep-rooted traditions of rural Dutch life. It’s small but dignified, surrounded by open fields and the gentle calm typical of the region. The gravestones are well maintained, and the overall atmosphere feels peaceful and respectful — a fitting resting place that carries both history and humility. A short visit leaves you with a sense of local heritage and community care, making it a quietly touching stop for anyone passing through Almkerk.",
