    "review_text": "This Jewish Cemetery (est. 1909) is one very special place for several reasons.\nIt is located almost hidden in the green.\nIts free and unused space indicates a kind of a sudden stop in funerals...\nIt is a reflection of the past bringing into memory that Groningen had a long tradition of being an open and safe city for minorities and people with sometimes different life stances.",
