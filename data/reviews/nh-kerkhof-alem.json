    "review_text": "The Begraafplaats in Alem is a calm, respectful resting place that serves its purpose well. It’s quietly kept, with simple gravestones and paths that allow for peaceful reflection. What’s good: it has a sense of care — no overgrowth, visible entry, enough respect in layout. What’s missing: there’s little signage or information, nothing that particularly distinguishes it or draws visitors beyond its local role. Three stars — because sometimes the modest feels honest, and not every place needs to be grand to be meaningful.",
